James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,The way Mr.,PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Mrs.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces.",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"She wanted to risk it, come what might, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""Now don't interrupt,"" he would beg of her.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven--who is that moving?--eight nine seven, dot and carry seven--don't speak, my own--and the pound you lent to that man who came to the door--quiet, child--dot and carry child--there, you've done it!--did I say nine nine seven?",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"yes, I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on nine nine seven?""",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""Remember mumps,"" he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went again.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay it will be more like thirty shillings--don't speak--measles one five, German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six--don't waggle your finger--whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings""--and so on it went, and it added up differently each time; but at last Wendy just got through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated as one.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom's Kindergarten school, accompanied by their nurse.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Mrs.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr.",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"She had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse.,PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked.",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,And gayest of all was Mrs.,PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Mrs.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,It is quite like tidying up drawers.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat].,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,That is why there are night-lights.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""Yes, he is rather cocky,"" Wendy admitted with regret.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Her mother had been questioning her.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""But who is he, my pet?""",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""He is Peter Pan, you know, mother.""",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,At first Mrs.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"There were odd stories about him, as that when children died he went part of the way with them, so that they should not be frightened.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""Besides,"" she said to Wendy, ""he would be grown up by this time.""",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""Oh no, he isn't grown up,"" Wendy assured her confidently, ""and he is just my size.""",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"She meant that he was her size in both mind and body; she didn't know how she knew, she just knew it.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Mrs.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Darling consulted Mr.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""Mark my words,"" he said, ""it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Leave it alone, and it will blow over.""",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Darling quite a shock.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with him.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile: ""I do believe it is that Peter again!""",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""Whatever do you mean, Wendy?""",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,"" Wendy said, sighing.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,She was a tidy child.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Unfortunately she never woke, so she didn't know how she knew, she just knew.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""What nonsense you talk, precious.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"No one can get into the house without knocking.""",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""I think he comes in by the window,"" she said.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""My love, it is three floors up.""",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?""",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Mrs.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""My child,"" the mother cried, ""why did you not tell me of this before?""",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"""I forgot,"" said Wendy lightly.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,She was in a hurry to get her breakfast.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Oh, surely she must have been dreaming.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"But, on the other hand, there were the leaves.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Mrs.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"Darling examined them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in England.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"She crawled about the floor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,She rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"She let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Certainly Wendy had been dreaming.,PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into shirts.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs.",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,She dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"He did not alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH,"The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor.",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 2 THE SHADOW,Again Mrs.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 2 THE SHADOW,"Darling screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 2 THE SHADOW,"She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, which proved to be the boy's shadow.",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"You never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe, it all depended upon Peter's whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was part of a game, but he could not stodge [cram down the food] just to feel stodgy [stuffed with food], which is what most children like better than anything else; the next best thing being to talk about it.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,Make-believe was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"Of course it was trying, but you simply had to follow his lead, and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,Wendy's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for herself; and she occupied it in making new things for them, and putting double pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees.",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,After that it followed her about everywhere.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,As time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had left behind her?,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"This is a difficult question, because it is quite impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry about her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave her complete ease of mind.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"What did disturb her at times was that John remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"These things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination papers on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on joining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table, writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on another slate and passed round.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"They were the most ordinary questions--""What was the colour of Mother's eyes?",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"Which was taller, Father or Mother?",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"Wendy, you see, had been forgetting, too.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but about this time Peter invented, with Wendy's help, a new game that fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his games.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to do.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him; and John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he would have treated them severely.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"He might have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went out you found the body; and, on the other hand, he might say a great deal about it, and yet you could not find the body.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling tale.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"But she was never quite sure, you know.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"There were, however, many adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself, and there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in them and said they were wholly true.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"To describe them all would require a book as large as an English-Latin, Latin-English Dictionary, and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,The difficulty is which one to choose.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,Should we take the brush with the redskins at Slightly Gulch?,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"It was a sanguinary affair, and especially interesting as showing one of Peter's peculiarities, which was that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"At the Gulch, when victory was still in the balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called out, ""I'm redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?""",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"And Tootles answered, ""Redskin; what are you, Nibs?""",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"and Nibs said, ""Redskin; what are you Twin?""",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"and so on; and they were all redskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real redskins fascinated by Peter's methods, agreed to be lost boys for that once, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than ever.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was--but we have not decided yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"Perhaps a better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily's life in the Mermaids' Lagoon, and so made her his ally.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter's friends, particularly of the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how the nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and Peter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"That is a pretty story, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would of course be telling two adventures rather than just one.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell's attempt, with the help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"Fortunately the leaf gave way and Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"Or again, we might choose Peter's defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round him on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly from trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,Which of these adventures shall we choose?,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,The best way will be to toss for it.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"I have tossed, and the lagoon has won.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,This almost makes one wish that the gulch or the cake or Tink's leaf had won.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"Of course I could do it again, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick to the lagoon.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"You must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy's lasting regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil word from one of them.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score, especially on Marooners' Rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who chatted with them on Marooners' Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails when they got cheeky.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,He gave Wendy one of their combs.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon, when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst.",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"Sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a pretty sight.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"Nevertheless we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted it.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"Wendy insisted on their doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was make-believe.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"So they lay there in the sun, and their bodies glistened in it, while she sat beside them and looked important.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners' Rock.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"The rock was not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was not looking.",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,While she stitched a change came to the lagoon.,PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"No, worse than that.",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"There crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners' Rock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them there to drown.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"They drown when the tide rises, for then it is submerged.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"Of course she should have roused the children at once; not merely because of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it was no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,But she was a young mother and she did not know this; she thought you simply must stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"So, though fear was upon her, and she longed to hear male voices, she would not waken them.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON,"Even when she heard the sound of muffled oars, though her heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them.",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"They were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their knees close to their ears; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"All went well until Slightly's turn came, when he was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string in going round and leave no tags [ends] with which to tie a knot.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"The pirates kicked him in their rage, just as you kick the parcel (though in fairness you should kick the string); and strange to say it was Hook who told them to belay their violence.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,His lip was curled with malicious triumph.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"While his dogs were merely sweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one part he bulged out in another, Hook's master mind had gone far beneath Slightly's surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and his exultation showed that he had found them.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Slightly, white to the gills, knew that Hook had surprised [discovered] his secret, which was this, that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need stick.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Poor Slightly, most wretched of all the children now, for he was in a panic about Peter, bitterly regretted what he had done.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Madly addicted to the drinking of water when he was hot, he had swelled in consequence to his present girth, and instead of reducing himself to fit his tree he had, unknown to the others, whittled his tree to make it fit him.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Sufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay at his mercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the subterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be alone.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,How to convey them?,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be rolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,Again Hook's genius surmounted difficulties.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,He indicated that the little house must be used as a conveyance.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"The children were flung into it, four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders, the others fell in behind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession set off through the wood.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"I don't know whether any of the children were crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound; but as the little house disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from its chimney as if defying Hook.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Hook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,It dried up any trickle of pity for him that may have remained in the pirate's infuriated breast.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"The first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling night was to tiptoe to Slightly's tree, and make sure that it provided him with a passage.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill omen on the sward, so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through his hair.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,Dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Intently he listened for any sound from the nether world, but all was as silent below as above; the house under the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void.",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"There was no way of knowing, save by going down.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Hook let his cloak slip softly to the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood on them, he stepped into the tree.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"He was a brave man, but for a moment he had to stop there and wipe his brow, which was dripping like a candle.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Then, silently, he let himself go into the unknown.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again, biting at his breath, which had almost left him.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"As his eyes became accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested, long sought for and found at last, was the great bed.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,On the bed lay Peter fast asleep.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a little time after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Then he decided not to take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she had always tucked them inside it, because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,Then he nearly cried; but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful than the dreams of other boys.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"For hours he could not be separated from these dreams, though he wailed piteously in them.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"They had to do, I think, with the riddle of his existence.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"At such times it had been Wendy's custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap, soothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,But on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"One arm dropped over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little pearls.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,Thus defenceless Hook found him.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,He stood silent at the foot of the tree looking across the chamber at his enemy.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,Did no feeling of compassion disturb his sombre breast?,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"The man was not wholly evil; he loved flowers (I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no mean performer on the harpsichord); and, let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one thing.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,What stayed him was Peter's impertinent appearance as he slept.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"The open mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a personification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,They steeled Hook's heart.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"If his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt at the sleeper.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle, the door of Slightly's tree.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"It did not entirely fill the aperture, and he had been looking over it.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Feeling for the catch, he found to his fury that it was low down, beyond his reach.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"To his disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter's face and figure visibly increased, and he rattled the door and flung himself against it.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,Was his enemy to escape him after all?,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,But what was that?,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter's medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"He fathomed what it was straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a dreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that had come into his possession.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"These he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent poison in existence.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,Five drops of this he now added to Peter's cup.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"His hand shook, but it was in exultation rather than in shame.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"As he did it he avoided glancing at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely to avoid spilling.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim, and turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the tree.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,As he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, he wound his cloak around him, holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night, of which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to himself, stole away through the trees.",PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,Peter slept on.,PETER PAN
James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,"The light guttered [burned to edges] and went out, leaving the tenement in darkness; but still he slept.",PETER PAN

James Matthew Barrie,Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?,Peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it.,PETER PAN
